## infinite potential well model or the quantum well model
The equation `hc/lambda = (m^2 - n^2)h^2/(8mcL^2) + E(g)` relates to the energy levels of electrons in a solid, and is commonly used in the field of condensed matter physics.

Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that studies the physical properties of matter in its solid and liquid states. It is concerned with understanding the behavior of matter at the atomic and molecular scale, and includes topics such as the structure and behavior of materials, the behavior of electrons in solids, and the phenomena of phase transitions.

The equation is an example of a model that is used to describe the energy levels of electrons in a solid, and is based on the idea that the electrons in a solid can be treated as if they are confined to an infinite potential well. This model is useful for understanding the electronic properties of solids, such as their conductivity, optical properties, and electronic band structure.

## example
using the equation `hc/lambda = (m^2 - n^2)h^2/(8mcL^2) + E(g)` to determine the length of the infinite potential well (L) for three different nanoparticles of cadmium selenide, based on the wavelengths of light that they emit when irradiated by UV light.

In this equation, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, lambda is the wavelength of the emitted light, m and n are integers representing the energy levels of the electron before and after the transition, and E(g) is the energy of the forbidden bandgap.

The diameter of the nanoparticles (d) is not a variable in this equation, so it cannot be used to determine the lengths of the potential wells. Instead, you can use the known wavelengths of the emitted light and the energy levels of the electrons to solve for the unknown length L using the equation.

Once you have determined the lengths of the potential wells for the three nanoparticles, you can then use these values, along with the known wavelengths of light that you want the third nanoparticle to emit (590nm for orange light), to solve for the size (diameter) of the third nanoparticle using the same equation.

## To solve 
for the length of the infinite potential well (L) for the three nanoparticles of cadmium selenide, you will need to use the equation `hc/lambda = (m^2 - n^2)h^2/(8mcL^2) + E(g)` and the known values for the other variables in the equation.

For the first nanoparticle with a size of 2.34 nm and a wavelength of 536 nm, you can plug in the known values to get:
```
L = hc/lambda - (m^2 - n^2)h^2/(8mc) - E(g)
= (6.62607004 x 10^-34 m x 2.998 x 10^8 m/s)/(536 x 10^-9 m) - (m^2 - n^2) (6.62607004 x 10^-34 m)^2/(8 x 9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg x 2.998 x 10^8 m/s) - E(g)
```
For the second nanoparticle with a size of 2.52 nm and a wavelength of 570 nm, you can use the same equation with the corresponding values:
```
L = hc/lambda - (m^2 - n^2)h^2/(8mc) - E(g)
= (6.62607004 x 10^-34 m x 2.998 x 10^8 m/s)/(570 x 10^-9 m) - (m^2 - n^2) (6.62607004 x 10^-34 m)^2/(8 x 9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg x 2.998 x 10^8 m/s) - E(g)
```
Solving for L in these equations will give you the lengths of the potential wells for the two nanoparticles.

To determine the size of the third nanoparticle that will emit orange light with a wavelength of 590 nm, you can use the same equation, but with the desired wavelength and one of the determined values for L. This will give you the size (diameter) of the third nanoparticle.

Keep in mind that this solution assumes that the energy levels of the electrons, the energy of the forbidden bandgap, and the other constants in the equation are known and fixed. If any of these values are unknown or variable, they will also need to be taken into account in the solution.
